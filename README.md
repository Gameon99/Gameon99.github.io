# Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe, also called the noughts and crosses or X's and O's is a classic game played against a computer or another player. The players take turns marking the spaces in the 3x3 grid. The first one to finish placing 3 of their marks either in a horizontal or vertical or a diagnol is the winner . 

The project so far done contains code files which enable two games, a single player and a two player. Each game is embedded with options of hint,undo and replay which can be used any number of times during the game. 

#Single Player
In the single player, the game allows you to play against a computer over three different levels, easy, medium and hard. Three buttons have been designed and you can switch between them at any moment in the game.
The game also allows you to choose your first turn. The first turn can be yours or a computer's. Two buttons human and computer have been designed for this purpose.

#Two Player
In the two player, the game is so designed to place between two humans. Each player is alternatively given a turn. The turn is specified using two buttons, Player 1's turn and Player 2's turn. The buttons get highlighted blue to show the turn.
